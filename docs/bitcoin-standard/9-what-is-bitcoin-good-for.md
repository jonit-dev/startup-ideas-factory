# Chapter 9: What Is Bitcoin Good For? The Primacy of Store of Value

Chapter 9, "**What Is Bitcoin Good For?**," transitions from the technical description of Bitcoin in the previous chapter to explore its practical applications and economic significance. The chapter argues forcefully that Bitcoin's most compelling and immediate use case, derived directly from its unique properties, is as a superior **store of value** for the digital age. While acknowledging other potential roles, the analysis centers on Bitcoin's capacity to preserve wealth across time.

## Bitcoin as a Superior Store of Value

This function is presented as the **central theme** and Bitcoin's most crucial contribution to the monetary landscape. The chapter meticulously breaks down _why_ Bitcoin excels in this role:

### 1. Absolute Scarcity: The Foundation

Building directly on Chapter 8, this section reiterates Bitcoin's most revolutionary feature: its **absolute scarcity**, capped immutably at 21 million coins.

- **Immunity to Inflation:** Unlike government-issued fiat currencies, which can be created at will, or even precious metals like gold, whose supply increases with mining efforts, Bitcoin's supply is predetermined and finite. This programmatic scarcity fundamentally protects it from the debasement and value erosion inherent in inflationary assets. It offers a predictable monetary landscape absent political manipulation of the supply.

### 2. High Salability Across Time

The confidence generated by absolute scarcity directly translates into **high salability across time**.

- **Long-Term Preservation:** Individuals and institutions can hold Bitcoin with a reasonable expectation that its scarcity will help preserve, if not increase, its purchasing power over long horizons. This contrasts sharply with assets whose supply can be arbitrarily expanded, making them less suitable for intertemporal wealth preservation. The incentive structure favors holding ("hodling") for the long term.

### 3. Stock-to-Flow Dynamics: Quantifying Hardness

The chapter likely delves into the **Stock-to-Flow (S2F) ratio** as a key metric for assessing an asset's hardness and suitability as a store of value.

- **Comparison with Gold:** Bitcoin's S2F ratio (existing supply divided by annual production) is directly compared to gold's. While gold has historically boasted the highest S2F among commodities (~60), the chapter highlights Bitcoin's unique trajectory. In 2017, Bitcoin's S2F was already substantial (~25).
- **Programmed Hardening:** Crucially, due to the scheduled "halving" events where new supply issuance is cut in half approximately every four years, Bitcoin's S2F ratio is mathematically designed to increase over time. Projections indicate it was set to **surpass gold's S2F around 2022-2024** and will continue to rise exponentially.
- **Infinite Hardness:** Eventually, around the year 2140, when the last block rewards are mined, the flow will drop to zero, making Bitcoin's S2F ratio **theoretically infinite** â€“ the ultimate expression of monetary hardness. This predictable and increasing hardness provides a strong quantitative argument for its potential as a superior store of value.

### 4. Empirical Evidence: Growing Adoption

The chapter points to real-world adoption patterns as evidence supporting the store of value thesis.

- **Market Behavior:** The fact that Bitcoin's market capitalization and the total US dollar value of daily transactions continued to grow significantly even when the network faced limitations on the _number_ of transactions per block suggests users prioritize its value-holding capabilities over high-frequency payments. People were acquiring and holding Bitcoin primarily as an investment or savings vehicle.
- **Global Reach:** By 2018, millions worldwide had already chosen to allocate some portion of their wealth to Bitcoin, demonstrating growing global confidence in its function as a non-state store of value, particularly in regions with unstable local currencies or capital controls.

## Beyond Store of Value: Other Potential Roles

While emphasizing the store of value function, Chapter 9 also explores other potential applications, often stemming from its core properties:

### 1. Enhancing Individual Sovereignty

Connecting back to Chapters 7 and 8, Bitcoin empowers individuals financially.

- **Self-Custody:** By holding their own private keys, users can maintain direct control over their funds, independent of banks or governments. This offers resistance to censorship, seizure, and deplatforming, providing a level of financial autonomy previously unattainable, especially for those living under oppressive regimes or facing financial exclusion.

### 2. A Tool for Global Settlement

Bitcoin's borderless and permissionless nature makes it a potential candidate for settling large-value transactions globally.

- **Efficiency:** It can facilitate peer-to-peer transfers across borders 24/7, potentially faster and cheaper than traditional banking systems (like SWIFT) for certain use cases, bypassing intermediary fees and delays. Its utility shines particularly in online commerce and international remittances or settlements where trust is low or banking infrastructure is weak.

### 3. Potential Future Unit of Account

The chapter might cautiously suggest Bitcoin's _potential_ to eventually evolve into a global **unit of account**.

- **Long-Term Vision:** While acknowledging its current volatility makes it unsuitable for widespread pricing, the argument could be made that if Bitcoin achieves widespread adoption as a store of value and its purchasing power stabilizes, it could eventually serve as a neutral, global benchmark for pricing goods and services, fulfilling the final classical function of money. This remains a more speculative, long-term possibility contingent on its success as a store of value.

## Conclusion: A Digital Foundation for Value Preservation

In summary, Chapter 9 argues decisively that Bitcoin's primary and most evident utility lies in its function as a **digital store of value**, underpinned by its unique and unforgeable **absolute scarcity** and its demonstrably **increasing hardness (S2F ratio)**. While it also offers compelling possibilities for enhancing **individual financial sovereignty** and enabling efficient **global settlement**, these roles are often seen as complementary to, or emerging from, its foundational strength as a reliable preserver of wealth in an increasingly digital world. The chapter makes the case that Bitcoin provides a novel and potentially superior solution to the timeless human need to store value across time.
