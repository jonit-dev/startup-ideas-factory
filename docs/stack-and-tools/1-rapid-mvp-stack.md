 
# Rapid MVP Tech Stack (React + Vite + Supabase)

Launching a web app MVP in days requires a **lean stack** that minimizes backend work, leverages generous free tiers, and speeds up development. Below is a structured stack breakdown covering frontend, backend services, and essential tools — each chosen for quick setup and free or no-cost startup usage. This stack emphasizes serverless and BaaS (Backend-as-a-Service) solutions so you can validate your idea fast without managing infrastructure.

## Frontend: React + Vite (PWA-Ready & Responsive)

**React** is a no-brainer for MVPs due to its vast ecosystem and reusable components. Paired with **Vite** as the build tool, you get lightning-fast dev server startup and HMR (hot-reload) for rapid iteration. Vite’s optimizations make bundling and debugging quicker than older tooling like CRA or Webpack. Moreover, Vite makes it straightforward to enable PWA features via plugins. For example, the official vite-plugin-pwa can _“abstract away the complexity of manual PWA creation and integrate seamlessly”_ into your app ([Progressive Web App (PWA) with Vite : Development Guide - DEV Community](https://dev.to/hamdankhan364/simplifying-progressive-web-app-pwa-development-with-vite-a-beginners-guide-38cf#:~:text=Creating%20PWA%20without%20any%20framework,the%20help%20of%20a%20plugin)). This means you can add a service worker and offline support with minimal config, ticking the **PWA-ready** box easily.

To ensure **mobile responsiveness**, use a modern CSS framework or component library (discussed in _Developer Productivity_ below). Tools like Chakra UI provide built-in responsive design principles and accessible components out-of-the-box ([16 Best Free React UI Libraries in 2025](https://www.wearedevelopers.com/magazine/best-free-react-ui-libraries#:~:text=match%20at%20L190%20The%20Chakra,are%20also%20dark%20mode%20compatible)). In practice, that means your React components will adapt to mobile layouts with minimal custom CSS. Add a mobile-friendly CSS baseline (or something like Tailwind CSS utility classes) to quickly style your app for various screen sizes. Between React’s component model and a good UI kit, you can achieve a polished, responsive frontend in hours.

## Backend & Database: Supabase (BaaS)

**Supabase** serves as the all-in-one backend for this stack – it’s an open-source Firebase alternative that offers **PostgreSQL database, auth, storage, and serverless functions** in one service ([Yes, here are 4 stacks to build MVPs faster in 2023 | ITNEXT](https://itnext.io/yes-here-are-4-stacks-to-build-mvps-faster-in-2023-d874b097e4a8#:~:text=Supabase%20has%20fewer%20tools%20than,database%2C%20storage%20and%20edge%20functions)). This eliminates the need to set up a separate server or database; you get instant RESTful APIs and real-time capabilities from your database without writing custom API endpoints. Supabase’s UI (Supabase Studio) lets you manage tables and data visually, which speeds up development and can act as a lightweight admin panel for now. Their documentation and JS/TypeScript SDK are well-regarded – developers praise that _“their docs are pretty good, their SDKs are solid… and it’s easy to understand,”_ with a very **generous free tier** ([Free SaaS Startup Tech Stack. The best free tools to launch a fully… | by Joe Osborne | Medium](https://medium.com/@joerosborne/free-saas-startup-tech-stack-e8949047efd3#:~:text=4)). 

Crucially for a quick launch, Supabase requires **no server maintenance** on your part. Once you create a project, you get a hosted Postgres DB with auto-generated APIs for all tables (and you can still write SQL or use their client libraries for complex queries). This setup gives you the flexibility of an SQL relational schema (great if you have relational data or want to use SQL joins) while abstracting away the server. The free tier is ample for an MVP: you get 500 MB database storage and 5GB bandwidth at no cost ([Pricing & Fees | Supabase](https://supabase.com/pricing#:~:text=Database%20size)) ([Pricing & Fees | Supabase](https://supabase.com/pricing#:~:text=Bandwidth)), with the ability to handle plenty of initial traffic. Supabase is optimized for startups – it even pauses the DB when inactive to save resources and offers easy scaling later.

**Serverless functions** are also included via **Supabase Edge Functions**, which run on Deno in a serverless fashion. This is perfect when you need to run secure logic (like calling third-party APIs with secrets or handling webhooks) without a dedicated backend server. Supabase provides 500,000 function invocations free per month ([Pricing & Fees | Supabase](https://supabase.com/pricing#:~:text=Invocations)) – more than enough for early-stage usage. You can write these functions in TypeScript and deploy with a single command, and they’ll integrate with your Supabase auth and database seamlessly. This approach aligns with the “no traditional backend” requirement: any custom backend code can live in these on-demand functions or even be avoided entirely by using other no-code services as noted below.

## Authentication: Supabase Auth

User authentication can be set up in minutes with **Supabase Auth**, avoiding the need to implement login/security flows from scratch. Supabase Auth supports email/password, magic link email logins, and popular social OAuth providers (Google, GitHub, Facebook, etc.) out-of-the-box ([Pricing & Fees | Supabase](https://supabase.com/pricing#:~:text=Social%20OAuth%20providers)). It also handles password resets and email verification. All of this is included in the free tier with generous limits (50k monthly active users are free, and unlimited total users) ([Pricing & Fees | Supabase](https://supabase.com/pricing#:~:text=MAUs)) ([Pricing & Fees | Supabase](https://supabase.com/pricing#:~:text=Social%20OAuth%20providers)). In short, you won’t hit user limits in the MVP stage. 

Supabase provides pre-built auth UI widgets or you can use their SDK to build a custom sign-in form. Either way, the heavy lifting (securely storing passwords, OAuth token exchange, JWT generation) is managed for you. As a bonus, Supabase Auth is tightly integrated with the database’s row-level security; you can easily enforce that users can only access their own data by writing policies tied to the JWT user ID. This gives you security by default without a lot of custom code. As one startup engineer notes, Supabase offers _“out-of-the-box user management functions and endpoints,”_ making it a quick solution for auth ([Free SaaS Startup Tech Stack. The best free tools to launch a fully… | by Joe Osborne | Medium](https://medium.com/@joerosborne/free-saas-startup-tech-stack-e8949047efd3#:~:text=5)). 

*Alternatives:* If not using Supabase’s auth for some reason, **Auth0** or **Clerk** could be options – they have generous free tiers (Auth0 ~7,000 active users free, Clerk ~5,000 monthly users free). However, integrating a separate auth service adds complexity. Since Supabase is already in use for data, using its built-in Auth keeps the stack simple and avoids juggling multiple services. 

## File Storage: Supabase Storage

Most web apps need to handle file uploads (user photos, documents, etc.). **Supabase Storage** provides an S3-like object storage that ties in with your Supabase project. You can allow users to upload files directly from the frontend (secured by Supabase Auth policies so they can only access their own files). In an MVP, this is ideal because you avoid building a separate file server – Supabase’s API and dashboard let you manage buckets and access rules easily. The free tier includes **1 GB of storage and 50 MB max file uploads** ([Pricing & Fees | Supabase](https://supabase.com/pricing#:~:text=1%20GB%20included)), so it’s sufficient for small-scale usage (e.g. profile images, small docs). 

Using Supabase Storage means minimal backend work to get file uploads working. The frontend app can obtain a signed URL or use the Supabase client SDK to upload files. Supabase handles serving the files via a CDN. It even provides basic CDN caching for free ([Pricing & Fees | Supabase](https://supabase.com/pricing#:~:text=Max%20file%20upload%20size)). This approach is quick to set up and free for development and initial users.

If your app involves heavy image manipulation or you need image CDN transformations, you might later integrate **Cloudinary** or **imgix** (which have free tiers for basic usage). But initially, Supabase Storage will cover file upload needs without additional services. It keeps your stack unified and simpler to manage.

## Payments: Stripe

For monetization or any paid feature, **Stripe** is the go-to solution. It has no upfront cost – you pay only transaction fees when you earn revenue – which effectively makes it *free* for development and testing. Stripe is developer-friendly with excellent docs and a React SDK for embedding checkout forms. Critically for speed, you can use **Stripe Checkout** or **Payment Links** to offload most of the UI and compliance work. As one guide notes, _“Stripe is the way to go… you can use their Payment Links feature for a checkout page that redirects back to your app”_, sparing you from coding a custom payments UI ([Free SaaS Startup Tech Stack. The best free tools to launch a fully… | by Joe Osborne | Medium](https://medium.com/@joerosborne/free-saas-startup-tech-stack-e8949047efd3#:~:text=8)). This means in your MVP you might simply redirect users to a secure Stripe-hosted checkout page and Stripe will handle collecting card details, etc., then return to your app. 

Setting up Stripe can be done in a few hours: you create products/prices in the Stripe dashboard, and then integrate either a client-side Stripe button or an API call (from a serverless function) to create a checkout session. For subscriptions or more complex billing, Stripe also offers a **Customer Portal** out-of-the-box, so users can manage their billing (update card, cancel, etc.) without you building that UI. Using Stripe’s hosted solutions aligns with the rapid-launch ethos.

**Webhooks:** To know when payments succeed and update your app (e.g. mark a user as premium in your database), you can use a Supabase Edge Function (or any serverless function) as a Stripe webhook handler. Stripe will send events to your endpoint, and your function can then update Supabase (for example, toggling a user’s paid status). This avoids running a persistent server. Supabase has examples and even a **Stripe-Supabase integration guide** for reference ([Free SaaS Startup Tech Stack. The best free tools to launch a fully… | by Joe Osborne | Medium](https://medium.com/@joerosborne/free-saas-startup-tech-stack-e8949047efd3#:~:text=You%20may%20not%20always%20need,Stripe%20SDK%20and%2For%20Stripe%20webhooks)). 

Overall, Stripe’s free features and quick integration make it ideal for an MVP’s payment integration. You get fraud protection, receipts, and support for many payment methods out of the box, which would be far too much to build yourself in a short timeframe.

## Analytics & User Tracking

Understanding user behavior is key to iterating on your MVP, so analytics are a must — fortunately, many analytics tools have generous free tiers:

- **Google Analytics (GA4)** – Perfect for basic web analytics (page views, traffic sources, user geography, etc.). The basic version of Google Analytics is completely free ([Is Google Analytics Free? A Quick Breakdown of GA4 - BKA Content](https://bkacontent.com/is-google-analytics-free-a-quick-breakdown-of-ga4/#:~:text=Is%20Google%20Analytics%20Free%3F)) and will likely stay within limits for an early-stage app. Simply include the GA script or use Google Tag Manager in your React app. This will give you insight into how many users visit, which pages/features are popular, and where they drop off. GA4 also supports tracking custom events if you want to instrument specific actions in your app. The downside is GA’s complexity and privacy concerns, but for an internal MVP it’s a quick solution to get metrics.

- **Product Analytics (Mixpanel or Amplitude)** – For more detailed tracking of in-app actions and user funnels, a tool like Mixpanel or Amplitude can be very useful. Both offer *free startup plans*: Mixpanel’s free tier allows up to **100,000 monthly tracked users or 100 million events per month** ([Difference Between Free and Growth Plans: Event Limits Explained | Mixpanel Community](https://community.mixpanel.com/x/ask-ai/fxk8tchw8ggj/difference-between-free-and-growth-plans-event-lim#:~:text=Image%3A%20Slack%20logoView%20in%20Slack)) (which is huge for an MVP), and Amplitude likewise offers millions of events free. These platforms let you define events (e.g. “Project Created”, “Upgraded to Pro”) and then analyze conversion funnels, retention, and cohort behavior. This level of insight helps validate if users are engaging with the core value of your app. Initial setup is just adding their SDK to your React app and logging events on relevant user actions. 

- **User Behavior Tracking (Hotjar or Microsoft Clarity)** – To really see *how* users interact with your UI, consider session recording or heatmap tools. **Hotjar** has a free forever plan (limited to ~35 sessions per day on recordings) ([Hotjar vs Microsoft Clarity: An Honest Comparison](https://www.hotjar.com/blog/hotjar-vs-microsoft-clarity/#:~:text=BuiltWith)) ([Hotjar vs Microsoft Clarity: An Honest Comparison](https://www.hotjar.com/blog/hotjar-vs-microsoft-clarity/#:~:text=,sessions%20per%20project%2C%20per%20day)) which can capture where users click and scroll. **Microsoft Clarity** is **completely free** with high limits (up to 100k sessions per day) ([Hotjar vs Microsoft Clarity: An Honest Comparison](https://www.hotjar.com/blog/hotjar-vs-microsoft-clarity/#:~:text=,sessions%20per%20project%2C%20per%20day)), offering similar session replays and click heatmaps. These tools can be installed by adding a script, and they allow you to watch recordings of user sessions or view aggregate click maps, which is invaluable for UX feedback in the absence of large user surveys. For an MVP, a few recordings can quickly highlight UI pain points or confusing steps. Clarity in particular integrates with Google Analytics as well ([Clarity vs. Hotjar’s Free Forever Plan [2022] - Understand your customers | Microsoft Clarity Blog](https://clarity.microsoft.com/blog/clarity-vs-hotjars-free-forever-plan-2022/#:~:text=you%20want%20onto%20any%20Clarity,project%20you%20own)), so you can correlate quantitative metrics with session replays.

Using a combination of Google Analytics for traffic and something like Mixpanel for granular product events gives you a comprehensive view, all at zero cost initially. Just be mindful of privacy and include a basic privacy policy if recording user sessions. But in terms of stack, these services require no backend – just drop in their JS snippet or use their React SDK, and they handle data collection and dashboards externally.

## Optional: CMS or Admin Dashboard

If your MVP involves managing content (like blog posts, marketing pages, or frequently updating in-app copy) or you need a quick admin UI for internal data management, consider a **headless CMS** or admin tool to avoid building a custom interface:

- **Headless CMS (Contentful or Sanity):** These services let you define content models and provide an editor UI for non-developers to manage content, which your app can fetch via API. For example, you could use Contentful to manage marketing site content or in-app text snippets. Contentful has a free tier ($0 forever) including up to 10 users, 100k API calls/month and 50 GB CDN bandwidth ([Contentful Pricing | Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/pricing/#:~:text=)), which is plenty for a new product. Sanity.io is another option, offering generous quotas (e.g. 1 million API requests/month on free). These services are great if you have a lot of static content or need to frequently update app content without redeploying. Your React app would just pull data from the CMS via REST or GraphQL. This is optional – if your app is mostly user-generated content or data in Supabase, you might not need an external CMS initially.

- **Internal Admin Panel:** For managing your database data (users, entries, etc.), Supabase’s built-in dashboard might suffice (it lets you browse and edit table rows). If you need a friendlier UI or more complex admin workflows, you could spin up an open-source admin tool like **Appsmith** or **Budibase** (both free/self-hostable) or even use a low-code solution like **Retool** (which has a free tier for small usage). These can connect to Supabase and let you create admin dashboards without coding from scratch. Given the time constraint, you might delay building an admin interface unless absolutely needed – many teams simply use direct DB access or simple scripts in the earliest stages.

In summary, a headless CMS or ready-made admin can be a huge time-saver if your app requires those capabilities. They come with free tiers that accommodate MVP-scale usage. It’s easier to plug one in than to build a custom CMS in your timeframe.

## Hosting & Deployment: Vercel (or Netlify)

For hosting the React frontend (and any serverless functions), **Vercel** is a top choice, with Netlify as a close alternative – both have generous free plans for personal projects. Vercel in particular has a “hobby” plan that is **free forever** for small apps ([Find a plan to power your projects.](https://vercel.com/pricing#:~:text=Hobby)). You can deploy your app in seconds by connecting your GitHub repo; every push triggers an automated build and deploy. In the MVP phase, you’ll likely have low traffic, which Vercel’s free tier can handle (it includes ~100 GB bandwidth/month) ([Netlify vs Vercel - 2024 Free Hosting Face-Off - DEV Community](https://dev.to/lilxyzz/netlify-vs-vercel-2024-free-hosting-face-off-oo9#:~:text=Netlify%20vs%20Vercel%20,bandwidth%20at%20%2420%2F100%2C%20while)). A developer noted that *“Vercel’s free tier is nuts… You can deploy and serve your app instantly for free”*, which holds true ([Free SaaS Startup Tech Stack. The best free tools to launch a fully… | by Joe Osborne | Medium](https://medium.com/@joerosborne/free-saas-startup-tech-stack-e8949047efd3#:~:text=6)). Vercel will give you a `<your-app>.vercel.app` domain immediately, and you can add a custom domain later when needed.

**Netlify** offers a similarly robust free tier (also around 100 GB bandwidth, and many build minutes free). The choice often comes down to preference; both support deploying Vite/React apps seamlessly. They also support serverless functions if you need (Netlify Functions or Vercel Serverless Functions), though in this stack you might use Supabase Edge Functions instead. 

The key is that both eliminate any server setup – you don’t manage VMs or Docker containers, you just push code. They also provide built-in CDN, SSL, and continuous deployment. This aligns perfectly with the “rapid launch, minimal ops” goal. If you need to serve forms or handle backend on the same domain, these platforms’ serverless functions can complement Supabase (for example, Netlify forms can capture submissions without a backend, or Vercel functions could be used for certain API routes). But primarily, you’ll use them to host the static frontend. 

Deployment workflow: once configured, you literally just push to `main` branch and your site goes live (or use their CLI for manual deploys). Rollbacks and previews are also out-of-the-box, which de-risks quick iterations.

## Monitoring & Error Tracking: Sentry

During rapid development, **monitoring errors and performance** in your app is vital. **Sentry** is an excellent tool for this, and it has a free developer plan that should suffice for an MVP. The free tier offers tracking for about **10,000 events (errors) per month**, which is more than enough for a new app ([A Detailed Guide On Sentry Pricing & Plans](https://alerty.ai/blog/sentry-pricing#:~:text=The%20free%20tier,benefits%20without%20worrying%20about%20price)). With Sentry integrated in your React app, any runtime error or unhandled promise rejection will automatically be reported to your Sentry dashboard, along with stack traces and device info. This means if a user encounters a crash or bug, you’ll see it and can fix it fast, rather than waiting for user reports. Sentry also supports performance tracing (to catch slow page loads or API calls), even on the free plan in a limited capacity.

Integration is done via their SDK (`@sentry/react`) and takes just a few lines to initialize. It’s worth the minimal effort because it can save hours of debugging later by pinpointing issues in real-time. The free plan is limited to one user and 30 days data retention ([In-depth: PostHog vs Sentry](https://posthog.com/blog/posthog-vs-sentry#:~:text=In,totally%20free%20plan%20and)) ([In-depth: PostHog vs Sentry](https://posthog.com/blog/posthog-vs-sentry#:~:text=In,totally%20free%20plan%20and)), but for a small team that’s fine to start. 

In addition to Sentry, you might use platform-specific monitoring: for instance, Vercel provides basic traffic and performance insights in the dashboard ([Find a plan to power your projects.](https://vercel.com/pricing#:~:text=Fluid%20compute)), and Supabase shows you SQL query performance and invocation logs for debugging backend functions (with 1 day log retention on free tier) ([Pricing & Fees | Supabase](https://supabase.com/pricing#:~:text=Not%20included%20in%20free)). These can complement Sentry. But Sentry serves as a unified place for catching exceptions from the frontend (and you could also initialize it in Supabase Edge Functions if you want error reporting from those).

Overall, monitoring ensures your fast development pace doesn’t result in unnoticed crashes or regressions. It helps maintain quality even without a full QA phase.

## Forms & Email Notifications

Even without a custom backend, you can handle things like contact forms or notification emails using third-party services:

- **Form Handling:** If you need a **contact form or feedback form** on your site (e.g. a “Contact Us” or beta sign-up form), services like **Formspree** or **Web3Forms** are extremely handy. They provide an endpoint to which your form submits, and they will email you the submissions or let you view them in a dashboard, no backend required. Formspree’s free plan allows up to 50 form submissions per month ([Add a Free Contact Form to Your Website with Formspree - DEV Community](https://dev.to/aleksandrhovhannisyan/add-a-free-contact-form-to-your-website-with-formspree-3i49#:~:text=Formspree%20Free%20Plan%20Limitations)) – which is typically enough for an early MVP’s contact form. (It’s intended for low-volume use; if you expect more, Web3Forms offers ~250 submissions/month free ([Formspree Alternative - Web3Forms](https://web3forms.com/alternatives/formspree-alternative#:~:text=Free%20Submission%20Limit))). Setup is literally adding a form HTML element with Formspree’s post URL; you don’t have to write any server code to capture or email the form data. This is perfect for a quick launch contact form or early user sign-up list. Netlify also has a Forms feature if you host there, which can capture form submissions to their dashboard (free tier includes a decent number of submissions).

- **Transactional Email**: For sending emails from your app (beyond the auth emails Supabase sends for confirmations), use an **email API service**. A popular choice is **SendGrid** (free tier allows ~100 emails/day) ([Pricing and Plans | SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/en-us/pricing#:~:text=How%20does%20the%20free%20trial,work)), or **Mailgun** (offers a free trial, though no longer unlimited free beyond trial). With these, you can send emails like welcome messages, passwordless login links, or notifications to yourself (e.g. “A new user just signed up!”) by calling their API from a serverless function or even directly from the frontend using their client libraries (though sending from backend is more secure). For example, you could create a Supabase Edge Function that uses SendGrid’s Node SDK to send an email when triggered. 

  SendGrid’s free tier is easy to set up (just verify your sender domain). The allowance of 100 emails/day is sufficient for a small user base or internal testing ([Pricing and Plans | SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/en-us/pricing#:~:text=How%20does%20the%20free%20trial,work)). This way, you avoid setting up an SMTP server. Supabase can even integrate with external SMTP if you want to send Auth emails from your own domain ([Pricing & Fees | Supabase](https://supabase.com/pricing#:~:text=Included%20in%20free)), but that’s optional at MVP stage.

- **Email Automation / No-Code:** If you prefer a no-code approach for things like notification emails or drip campaigns, you could tie in a service like **Zapier** or **Make (Integromat)**. For instance, when a new row is created in your Supabase (new user), Zapier could detect it (via webhooks or polling) and send an email via Gmail or Mailchimp. Zapier’s free tier might handle a few hundred tasks/month. This avoids coding but can add a bit of setup time. For a developer-centric stack, using SendGrid directly is usually straightforward and more controlled.

In summary, you don’t need to build a backend to handle forms or emails. The above services fill that gap quickly and at low/no cost. They let you provide user feedback loops (like contacting you or receiving confirmations) which makes your app feel more complete without significant development effort.

## Developer Productivity Tools (UI Libraries & Testing)

Finally, to maximize development speed and code quality, leverage some free tools for **UI components and testing**:

- **UI Component Library:** Adopting a component framework can save you from coding common UI elements (buttons, menus, forms) from scratch and ensure consistency. **Chakra UI** is a great choice – it’s open-source and offers a set of accessible, responsive React components. Chakra emphasizes simplicity and consistent design, and all components support theming and dark mode out-of-the-box ([16 Best Free React UI Libraries in 2025](https://www.wearedevelopers.com/magazine/best-free-react-ui-libraries#:~:text=match%20at%20L190%20The%20Chakra,are%20also%20dark%20mode%20compatible)). Using Chakra (or an alternative like **Material-UI (MUI)**) means you can assemble a polished interface rapidly by composing ready-made components. For example, instead of custom-building a modal or dropdown, you use Chakra’s <Modal> or <Menu> components and spend time only on styling or logic unique to your app. This dramatically speeds up front-end development. Another lightweight option is **Tailwind CSS** utility classes combined with premade components (Tailwind UI or DaisyUI) – also free – which can be faster if you prefer customizing design in CSS. Choose whatever fits your style, but don’t start from scratch on UI in a time-crunched MVP.

- **Testing:** Even in an MVP built in days, adding a few tests can prevent breakages as you iterate. Thankfully, modern testing tools are fast and free. With Vite, you can use **Vitest** (a Vite-native testing framework similar to Jest) for unit and component tests. It’s very quick to set up and runs tests blazing fast since it leverages Vite’s bundler. For end-to-end testing of user flows, **Cypress** is a popular choice (its open-source version is free to use locally). You could write a couple of critical path tests (e.g. sign-up flow works, major pages load without errors) which will give confidence when making rapid changes. While you might not have time for exhaustive tests, having the basics ensures you catch bugs early. Both Vitest and Cypress integrate well with React apps and have lots of examples online. 

- **Dev Utilities:** Don’t forget code quality tools which are essentially zero-effort to add: **ESLint and Prettier** for consistent code formatting (many project templates include these), and maybe **Husky** + **lint-staged** to run checks on git commits. These keep your code clean as the team (if more than one developer) moves fast. Also, consider using **TypeScript** with React if possible – it can prevent many runtime errors, and Supabase’s SDK has TS support which helps you catch schema mismatches at build time. TypeScript is free and increasingly standard; it might slow you *slightly* at first if you’re new to it, but saves time debugging. Since you’re aiming to build in days, you could stick to pure JS, but TS is worth mentioning for any MVP that might evolve.

In short, leverage free libraries and tools to write less boilerplate and catch issues early. This lets you focus on your app’s unique features rather than reinventing wheels. The goal is **speed**, and standing on the shoulders of well-tested libraries and convenient tooling helps achieve that.

---

**Conclusion:** With this stack – **React + Vite frontend, Supabase backend (DB, Auth, Storage, Functions)** – plus integrations like **Stripe, Vercel, and various SaaS tools (analytics, forms, etc.)**, you can build a fully functional web app in very little time. Every component of this stack is either free or has a free tier that covers initial usage, keeping costs at zero while you validate your idea. Moreover, they are all **scalable**: if your app gains traction, you can seamlessly upgrade (Supabase can scale the DB, Stripe and others will just handle more volume, and you can stick with the same stack into production). This minimizes the need for a rewrite post-MVP.

By avoiding a traditional backend server and using serverless and no-code services, you drastically cut down development overhead. Each tool serves a focused purpose (e.g. auth, payments, analytics) and is best-in-class, so you’re not compromising on functionality. Importantly, these choices are popular and well-documented – you’ll find plenty of example repos and community support for each integration, which is a big help when moving fast.

Use this stack as a starting blueprint, and adjust pieces based on your app’s specific needs. With the above in place, you can concentrate on building your app’s core features and **launching quickly** to gather user feedback – which is the ultimate goal of a rapid MVP. Good luck with your build!
